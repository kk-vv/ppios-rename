In order to regenerate the contents of this directory:

1. Prepare the test sources:
  cd test/apps/BoxSim
  make build
  ppios-rename --analyze -F '!BSClassO' build/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/BoxSim.app
  ppios-rename --obfuscate-sources

2. In Xcode, archive the project (You may need to add signing credentials).
3. Export to an .ipa, without rebuilding from bitcode.
4. Deploy to a device via iTunes.
5. Invoke a crash by tapping "Just Go" three times.
6. In Xcode, review the crash logs on the device.
7. Select the crash log, very quickly copy the unsymbolicated text with Command-A, Command-C, and paste this into 'unsymbolicated.crash'.
8. Wait for Xcode to symbolicate the crash and copy that text to 'symbolicated.crash'.
9. Copy the .dSYM from the archives (~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/{Date}/BoxSim {Date}, {Time}.xcarchive/dSYMs/BoxSim.app.dSYM).
